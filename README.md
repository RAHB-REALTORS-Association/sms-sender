# Bulk SMS Sender

## About
Bulk SMS Sender is a web-based app that uses a Twilio account to send SMS messages in bulk from a CSV file. The CSV file can be uploaded via a web form or fetched from a provided URL. 

## Usage
The user inputs their Twilio credentials and either uploads a CSV file or provides a CSV URL via a webform. The backend uses Twilio's Python SDK to send the messages and generate a delivery report.

## Configurability
The Twilio credentials and CSV URL can be preset using the following environment variables: `TWILIO_SID`, `TWILIO_TOKEN`, and `CSV_URL`. If these are set, their values will be used as defaults in the web form. 

## Tech stack
- Python 3.9 - 3.11
- Flask 2.3+
- GUnicorn 20.1+
- Twilio Python Libraries 8.5+
